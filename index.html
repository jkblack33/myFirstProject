    <h1>Five Step Plan to Take Over The World</h1>
    <img src="villain.jpg" width=500px height=auto />
    <h2>Step One: Start a Corporation</h2>
    <p>Corporations are the best thing in the world. They are considered a "legal person" and can shield you from liability from the other 99%. And the best thing about corporations:</p>
    <h3>MONEY.</h3>
    <p>Lots and lots and lots of money.</p>
    <p>Use your Corporation to make money and shield your wealth so you can invest it to fuel your ambitions.</p>
    <h2>Step Two: Buy Up Everything</h2>
    <p>Use your ill-gotten gains to buy up everything. Everything.</p>
    <p>Hospitals. Schools. Pharmaceutical Companies. Grocery Stores. You name it.</p>
    <p>Just approach them and offer a deal. Be like: "Hey, I'm buying you out. So, yeah."</p>
    <p>And if they refuse, just kneecap em.</p>
    <p>They can't go after you because the "Corporation" did it. Not you. In fact, it was a subsidiary. Who cares.</p>
    <h2>Step Three: Buy the Government</h2>
    <p>Find and up and coming young politian and fund his campaign. Get him a seat in office.</p>
    <p>Ideally he'd be married. And has a vice. You can use this.</p>
    <p>Buy him an escort. Throw a party. Take pictures.</p>
    <p>Now you own him.</p>
    <p>You're welcome.</p>
    <h2> Step Four: Start A Private Military Company</h2>
    <h2>Do Whatever You Want</h2>
    <p>Now you got money, you own precious resources, you own the government and you own your own private army.</p>
